Just a free-time project...

How do I use this?

- Globally install Node's 'http-server' module via npm.  

- 'cd' into the 'backbone-animation-project' (or what ever you named your dir) directory.

- 'pwd' to make sure you're in the right place.

- Type: http-server

- Go to 'localhost:8080/app'

- If port '8080' is taken up, or you want to use a certain port; type: http-server -p 8181 (or what ever you want...).

- (Dummy Tests for now...), but to run them; go to 'localhost:8080/app/specs/test.html'...

- Done...
