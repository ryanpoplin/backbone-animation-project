Just a free-time project...

How do I use this?

- Globally install Node's 'http-server' module via npm.  

- 'cd' into the 'backbone-animation-project' directory.

- 'cd' into the 'app' directory.

- 'pwd' to make sure you're in the right place.

- Type: http-server

- Go to 'localhost:8080/app'

- Done...
