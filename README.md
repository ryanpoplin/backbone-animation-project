Will be working on a paid project for a few weeks and will not have the time to work on this. However, It's at a great starting point and I'll get back to it as soon as possible. If you want to see why this is already badass as is; clone or fork this repo and open your web browser console; once you've served it. Start typing and clicking on the canvas element...

It picks up your every move!

How do I use this?

- Globally install Node's 'http-server' module via npm.  

- 'cd' into the 'backbone-animation-project' (or what ever you named your dir) directory.

- 'pwd' to make sure you're in the right place.

- Type: http-server

- Go to 'localhost:8080/app'

- If port '8080' is taken up, or you want to use a certain port; type: http-server -p 8181 (or what ever you want...).

- (Dummy Tests for now...), but to run them; go to 'localhost:8080/app/specs/test.html'...

- Done...
